# Noteful Refactor with Context Exercise


## Refactor your Noteful application to use context instead of prop-drilling.
 - passing props from app.js to the note
 - passing to navbar/folders 


## Implement two fetch requests to two endpoints when the application mounts: /folders and /notes. Store the response from these requests using a setState in whichever component you were keeping your dummy state.
- to eliminate use of dummy-store.js


## Implement the delete button for each note in the list in the main route and folder route.
- click event in note.js?
- DELETE in app.js ?


## Implement the delete button on the note page, if the delete is successful, redirect to the / path.
- click event in note.js?
- DELETE in app.js ?

## The API calls will be made to a local server called noteful-json-server that you'll need to have running separately to your noteful React application.
- installed local server
